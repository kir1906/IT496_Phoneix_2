<h2> Identify and list classification problems on your assigned dataset: </h2>


<b> Alcohol Consumption: </b>
<br>
Binary classification: Predict whether an individual is a heavy drinker (1) or a non-heavy drinker (0) based on factors like weekly alcohol intake.
<br>
Multiclass classification: Categorize individuals into alcohol consumption levels (e.g., non-drinker, light drinker, moderate drinker, heavy drinker).
<br>

<b> Smoking Status: </b>
<br>
Binary classification: Predict whether an individual is a smoker (1) or a non-smoker (0) based on attributes such as 'age', 'sex', 'SBP' (systolic blood pressure), and 'DBP' (diastolic blood pressure). This is interesting as it can help in understanding the relationship between smoking and various health indicators like blood pressure.
<br>

<b> Liver Function and Enzyme Levels: </b>
<br>
Binary classification: Predict whether an individual has abnormal liver function (1) or normal liver function (0) based on attributes like 'SGOT_AST', 'SGOT_ALT', and 'gamma_GTP'. This could be interesting for understanding the relationship between liver health and lifestyle factors.
<br>

<b> Health Risk Assessment: </b>
<br>
Binary classification: Predict whether an individual is at high risk (1) or low risk (0) of health issues based on a combination of attributes such as 'age', 'sex', 'SBP', 'DBP', 'hemoglobin', 'cholesterol' levels, and smoking and drinking habits. This is a complex problem but could be the most interesting as it involves multiple health-related attributes and behaviors.
<br>

<b> Sight and Hearing Problems: </b>
<br>
Binary classification: Predict whether an individual has sight or hearing impairment (1) or not (0) based on 'sight_left', 'sight_right', 'hear_left', and 'hear_right' attributes. This problem can help in assessing the impact of smoking and drinking on sensory health.

<h2> Which one does seem the most interesting to you and why? </h2>
<h4>
Among all given classification problems prediction of "Alcohol consumption" and "Smoking status" seems most interesting. The reason these problems are intriguing is because they are directly related to common lifestyle choices and habits that have significant implications for public health and individual well-being. Alcohol consumption is a widespread behavior with varying levels of consumption, and it is associated with various health outcomes. Smoking is a well-documented health risk factor, and understanding its prevalence is vital for public health initiatives.
